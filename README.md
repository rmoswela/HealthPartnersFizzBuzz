# HealthPartnersFizzBuzz
This project is part of HealthPartners interview to create small fizz buzz program using SOLID design principles and Reflection.

## The challenge

The coding challenge we would like you to complete is:

***“To create a solution to the Fizz Buzz problem, using C#, that is built using Reflection and which demonstrates a clean, Test Driven approach using SOLID design principles.”***

Again the problem you are looking to solve is:

> Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
> * If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
> * If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
> * If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the number.
> * If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.

> For the purpose of this test you should use a range of 1 to 100. Output of the results should be to a console window.
